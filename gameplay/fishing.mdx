## How to fish

Players can only fish at fishing spots that are marked with a circle of fish.

To actually fish, players have to cast their line with a fishing rod in their inventory once they are close enough. Players will have to wait for some time, and are notified when there is a fish biting. Players will then be prompted to press a key repeatedly until the fish is reeled in. Players can choose to stop fishing early if desired.

As fish are caught, they will pop up displaying their type along with a brief description. Players can cook or sell the fish.
