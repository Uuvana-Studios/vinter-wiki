Craft new items by combining two or more items in the Workbench. The Workbench can either be bought at Sgt. Lakes Outpost or found in containers around the map. You are able to craft furniture, weapons and also craft seeds from berries/flowers. There is also two ways to upgrade your camp with the workbench.

<Note>**Note:** Certain items can only be crafted once you unlocked their respective blueprints.</Note>
