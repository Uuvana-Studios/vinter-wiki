Hunting is a skill that is used to get feathers & antlers. There are eight types of feathers obtainable by huting four kinds of birds in Longvinter. There are also two types of antlers obtainable by hunting one kind of reindeer. Hunting requires a some kind of weapon. The dropped feathers & antlers can be sold for Mk.

## How to hunt

You can kill birds & reindeers using crossbows, chainsaws, hatchets, machetes, or guns. Hunting can be a good source of income as opposed to fishing. However, hunting is significantly harder than fishing since prey will run away as soon as you get close to it.

<Note>**Note:** Use fences to surround bird or reindeer spawn points. This will allow you to save ammo as you can kill them by using a melee weapon. Check out the bird farm guide for examples.</Note>
