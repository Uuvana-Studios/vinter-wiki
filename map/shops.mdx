# Shops

Shops, stores and NPC vendors give players the possibility to buy and sell items. They are a great way to earn money and to get rid of items you don't need.

## James General Store

James General Store is the most important store in all of Longvinter, here you are able to sell (with a few exceptions) any item you own. You can also buy items from James General Store but only if a player has sold it to the store before in the last 12 hours.
