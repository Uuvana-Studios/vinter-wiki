Bunkers are underground looting locations that are guarded by multiple NPCs. Certain bunker locations will require a standard access card. Standard access cards can be found randomly from loot containers. Each bunker will have a locked vault accessible with a high level access card. 

## Bunker Locations

- Krokon Island
- Kolkka Island (Requires Access Card: Standard for entry.)
- Kump Island
- Jumo Island (Requires Access Card: Standard for entry.)

## Locked Vaults

Locked vaults contain uncommon loot similar to those spawned at PVP arenas. The loot may include guns, gun kits, combat hats, strawberry hats, and much more. The vaults will also contain a research table that will reward research documents when a [research quest](/gameplay/quests) is active.
