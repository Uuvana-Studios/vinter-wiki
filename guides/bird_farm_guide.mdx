## Building the farm

<Note>**Note:** See if there is a tent, sauna or house nearby that you can access so the animals can respawn.</Note>

To build a bird/reindeer farm you first have to find a spawnpoint for the birds/reindeers. You can find the general locations of animal spawnpoints on the map below.

<Tip>If you know who made this map create an issue on GitHub so we can give proper credits.</Tip>

You then can simply try to place an item there and when you see a red circle similar to the one below you know that you found a spawnpoint.

Now all you have to do is circle the red circle with fences and leave a wide pointing opening that gets smaller towards the end. This will make the birds/reindeers run into the opening and get stuck there.

## Farming

Now just grab a chainsaw and start killing the birds/reindeers. Once all the animals are dead enter and leave a tent, sauna or house that is nearby and the animals will respawn instantly.
