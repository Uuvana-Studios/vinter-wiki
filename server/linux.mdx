## Research Tent

Tents can be purchased at Sgt. Lakes Outpost and Arturs Outpost for around 700 mk. Each player can place a maximum of 2 tents/houses. You will have 24 hours to upgrade their tent to a house. If it is not completed within 24 hours, the tent will be removed along with items placed inside the tent. A workbench is needed for depositing 100 pieces of wood in order to upgrade the tent into a house.

## House

Once you deposited all the required wood, you can pick between 5 different house colours: red, blue, mint, pink, and yellow. You will also be prompted to set a 5 digit PIN code. Do not give this code to anyone you don’t trust! This PIN code can be shared to other players that you wish to grant access inside your house. You can view the decay status of your house under the “Decay” tab within the workbench. Add wood to prevent your house from being removed permanently.

**Tips:**

- You do not need to enter the PIN code to enter your own house.
- If “share house with team” is selected, teammates will be able to enter your house without the PIN code.
- Change your code if you want to revoke access from teammates.

## Electricity Upgrade Path

There are currently two different electricity upgrade paths you can choose for your house. Your choice is locked after your first upgrade. You can pick between Sustainable or Fuel powered.

### Sustainable

Sustainable powered houses will be equipped with a windmill and solar panels. Windmills provides a continuous flow of 50 electricity during the day and night. Solar panels will only generate 25 electricity during the day time.

### Fuel Powered

Fuel powered houses will be equipped with a large generator. The large generator provides 110 electricity during the day and night. However, fuel cans need to be added at the workbench for electricity generation. Each fuel can provides 3 hours of electricity generation.

## Dark Panel Interior Upgrade

This is purely a cosmetic upgrade to turn your floor into black tiles.

## Second Floor Upgrade

This upgrade will change the interior and exterior look of your house. You will have a second floor allowing more space to place containers and furniture.
